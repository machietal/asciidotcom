It would have been cool to do this from the get go, but being 18, it can serve as something ive started at the beginning of my adult life, and hopefully will be something I continue and maintain far into the future.<br>This will serve to be something between an archive of my own thoughts and ramblings, and my own notes and tutorials   catered entirely to myself.<br><strong>My new years resolutions are to:</strong>    <ol> <li>Create at least <hl>one project a week</hl>, with a different focus, <hl>documenting it here</hl> along the way.</li>    <li>Take a walk every day.</li>    <li>Get my nutrition and sleep in check.</li></ol>   I don't have much else to put here today, except that I hope I get this up and running soon!"
